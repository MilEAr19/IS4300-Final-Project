# IS4300-Final_Project

This project is about the number of passes in the Bundesliga (League) and Champions League (Tournament) matches, which Bayern Munich made in the 2019-2020 season. I have to higlight the reason why I chose this german team was because it came champion in both competitions.

The amount of passes in these two competiotions will be compared and it will be revealed the position and the player who most passes delivered succesfully to the team.
